Firefox addon ScrapBook X CopyPageInfo is an open project based on CopyPageInfo Plus for ScrapBook Plus / XSidebar.

CopyPageInfo allows you to copy to clipboard the meta-informations (e.g. title and URL) of saved pages. [Copy Page Info] menu is added to the right-click menu in Sidebar tree. You can copy all items in a folder by right-clicking the folder and select the menu. And you can copy sub-folders recursively by middle-clicking [Copy Page Info] menu. [Tools] > [Add-on Functions] > [Copy Page Info : Entire Tree] menu enables you to copy root folder or entire tree recursively.

You can configure the format of copied informations. Go to Sidebar, [Tools] > [Add-on Functions] > [Copy Page Info : Configure] then select favorite one from [Preset] menu or follow the instruction to customize your format.
